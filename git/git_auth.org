As of 2021-08-13, account passwords are not accepted for authenticating git operations. Instead, git operations will require token-based authentication (e.g. personal access token) or OAuth/GitHub App installation token.

* setup personal access token for general git operations
** get token

1. log into GitHub
2. go to personal access token settings
   a. click on user icon at top right corner > =Settings= > =Developer settings= > =Personal access tokens=
   b. go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. click =Generate new token=
4. give the token a description/name and select the scope of the token
   a. select =repo= only to facilitate pull, push, clone, and commit actions
5. click =Generate token=
6. copy the token (to be used as password)

** configure local git
1. run a git operation, e.g. =git clone <private-repo>=, =git push=
2. input copied token as password
3. store credentials
   a. temporary
      #+begin_src bash
      git config --local credential.helper "cache --timeout=86400"
      #+end_src
   b. permanently (can't be set to locally)
      this saves the credentials to =~/.git-credentials=

      #+begin_src bash
      git config credential.helper store
      #+end_src
